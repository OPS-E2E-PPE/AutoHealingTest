# Restore a suspended Microsoft Partner Center account

Learn how to restore a Microsoft Partner Center account that has been suspended. 

> [!NOTE]
> This task is different from [restoring a deleted customer account](../manage-customers/manage-user-accounts.md).

## Why Partner Center accounts are suspended

Microsoft might suspend a Partner Center account for one of the following reasons:

- The current billing amount is more than 60 days past due.
- A significant amount of abuse is detected.
- Issues that affect indirect provider operations are negatively affecting your account (indirect resellers only).

## What to do if your account is suspended

* If you know that your account billing is current, [submit a support request](../../support/create-azure-csp-support-request.md) to find out why your account was suspended.

* If the account is past due, follow the instructions on your bill to arrange a payment. Then, [submit a support request](../../support/create-azure-csp-support-request.md) to have the account reinstated.

* If you are not sure whether your account billing is current, to check your bill, on the **Dashboard** menu, select **Billing**. This page shows billing history and trends, the balance due for the current month, and the most recent payment. It also has  links to invoices and reconciliation files.
