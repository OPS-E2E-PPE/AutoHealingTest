# Support options for Azure CSP partners

If you are an Azure CSP direct partner, with your Microsoft Partner Center account, you receive a free Azure Cloud Solution Provider (Azure CSP) support plan. You are still [responsible for Azure CSP customer support](azure-csp-support-overview.md). But, if you encounter a problem that you cannot fix on your own, you can use your support plan to escalate customer issues to Microsoft.

Some Azure CSP partners might want a deeper level of support for Azure services for their customers. For this reason, two higher levels of support are available: [Advanced Support for Partners (ASfP)](https://partner.microsoft.com/Support/advanced-cloud-support?advancedcloudsupport) and [Premier Support for Partners (PSfP)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftservices/premier-support-partners.aspx). In this article, we describe the difference between these paid support plans and the free pricing tier.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This article covers only the support options that are available to Azure CSP direct partners. If you are an Azure CSP indirect reseller, contact your Azure CSP indirect provider to learn about the options that are available to you.

## Azure CSP support plan comparison

The following table gives you an at-a-glance view of the primary differences between the free Azure CSP support plan and the paid support tiers (ASfP and PSfP).

## Service details

### Services Account Management

The Services Account Management team is a team of managers who act as service and support advisors. Team members deliver proactive guidance about potential blockers, and offer assistance in the most critical cases.

At the ASfP level, you have access to 5 hours per month with the Services Account Management team. Additional hours per month are available as an add-on purchase.

At the PSfP level, you have a designated Technical Account Manager (TAM) who provides personalized services in proactive planning and resolution handling.

### Azure Cloud Services technical break-fixes

With both the ASfP and PSfP levels of support, you can contact Microsoft as needed by phone and email to resolve Azure Cloud Services break-fix support incidents. This gives you a more direct line to the support you need when issues arise.

### Reduced response times

As described in the Azure CSP support plan comparison table, response times by severity are cut in half for Azure CSP partners who have ASfP and PSfP levels of support. For partners who have these support levels, support requests filed with Microsoft are given priority. Severity A issues receive a response in 1 hour or less. If necessary, Severity A issues can be escalated to the Services Account Management team. This does consume an ASfP partner's allotted plan hours.

### 24/7 critical situation support

PSfP partners receive support 24/7 if critical situations arise and support is urgently needed. Microsoft Support engineers work on problem resolution 24/7. Support engineers transfer a case from one time zone to another to ensure that an engineer is working on a problem continuously.
