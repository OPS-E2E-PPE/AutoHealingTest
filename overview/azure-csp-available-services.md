# Available Azure services in Azure CSP

This article discusses the Azure services that are and are *not* available in the Azure Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program. It also discusses service availability in the national clouds [Microsoft Azure Germany](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/clouds/germany/) and [Microsoft Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/clouds/government/).

>[!NOTE]
>[Azure China](https://www.azure.cn/) is not available in the Azure CSP program.

If you are a partner or customer who already uses Azure through [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/), [Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/), or other license channels, keep in mind that not all Azure services are currently available in the CSP program.

For example, because Azure CSP supports only the Azure Resource Manager model, non-Azure Resource Manager services are not available in the program. Several Azure Resource Manager services are also not available in the program. However, the situation is changing quickly.

## Azure products, services, and features in Azure CSP

The following table displays a regularly updated list of the available first-party Azure products, services, and features in Azure CSP. For more information about services at the regional level, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).

## Comments

- Some Azure network services are not region-specific. They can be deployed inside a global Azure subscription and used for national cloud purposes. These services include:
  - Azure Content Delivery Network
  - Azure DNS
  - Azure Traffic Manager

- *[Non-Azure Resource Manager services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model)* and the *[Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com)*. Services that are not available in Azure CSP include:
    - *VMs, virtual networks, and storage accounts that were created by using the classic deployment model.*

    - *[Azure Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services/)*:  Consider switching to Azure Resource Manager-based VMs, App Service, and virtual machine scale sets.

    - *Mobile Services*: Use [Mobile Apps feature of Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/mobile/) instead.

    - *[Azure RemoteApp](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/remoteapp/remoteapp-whatis)*: This service is deprecated.

- *[StorSimple Virtual Array Manager](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/hybridcloudbp/2017/02/27/storsimple-in-csp/)*: This service is available in Azure CSP, but StorSimple Physical Array Manager is not. You can purchase and manage physical StorSimple devices only through an Enterprise Agreement.

- *[Operations Management Suite (OMS) components](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/hybridcloudbp/2017/02/17/oms-in-csp/)*: These components are available as separate Azure services. OMS E1 and E2 SKUs are not available in CSP.

- *Azure Active Directory Premium* and *Azure Multi-Factor Authentication*: These services are available as license-based subscriptions in Partner Center, outside the regular Azure usage-based subscriptions.

- *Azure Active Directory Domain Services* - This service is now available in CSP. For more information see [Azure Active Directory (AD) Domain Services for Azure Cloud Solution Providers (CSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-csp).

- *Azure App Service*: There is no support for integration with third-party Azure Marketplace applications (for example, ClearDB) because third-party Marketplace applications aren't enabled for Azure CSP subscriptions yet.

- *Key Vault*: The process for setting up Ke
y Vault for Azure CSP subscriptions is the same as that for other types of Azure subscriptions (Enterprise Agreement, Pay-As-You-Go). However, the vault access control list (ACL) policy must be set up manually. For more information, see [Setting up Key Vault for Azure CSP subscriptions](https://azurecsp.blob.core.windows.net/files/key-vault-in-csp.docx).

- *Azure Time Series Insights*: This service is available in Azure CSP, but please note that only users from the customer tenant can access data in their Time Series Insights environment. Partners can manage their customer’s Time Series Insights environment by default, but if they need access to the data in it, they must be added to the customer tenant. For more information see [Azure Time Series Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/time-series-insights/).

## Visual Studio Marketplace
You can now purchase items from Visual Studio Marketplace with the exception of third party extensions for your customers.  This includes:
- [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/)
- [Visual Studio cloud subscriptions](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/)
- [Xamarin University training](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.xamarin-university)

To help get you started, we have created videos and documentation about [how to set up, purchase, and manage Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/billing/csp/set-up-csp-customer) in CSP.

> [!TIP]
> Check Azure Services in the Azure CSP Release Notes on the [Partner Center Pricing and Offers page](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/sales) (requires authorization).

## Azure Marketplace items in Azure CSP
Not all Azure Marketplace items are currently available in Azure CSP subscriptions.

- *Microsoft-based Azure services*: These services are available. Review the previous table and comments.

- *Bring your own license* (BYOL) items: These items are available. A full list of BYOL-enabled Azure Marketplace items is available on the [Azure Marketplace BYOL page](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?filters=byol).

- *Pay-As-You-Go third-party Azure Marketplace items*: These items are available if the provider has published to the CSP channel.For more information, see [Sell subscriptions to Azure Marketplace products](https://aka.ms/marketplaceincsp)
 
Learn more here:
- *Citrix XenApp Essentials*: Partners can purchase XenApp Essentials for customers in CSP. For more information, see Citrix Blog- [Distribution of XenApp Essentials now available through Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Channel](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2018/02/01/xenapp-essentials-now-available-through-microsoft-cloud-solution-provider-channel/).
